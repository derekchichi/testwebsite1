Right-hander Tomoyuki Sugano and the Baltimore Orioles have agreed to a contract, the team announced Monday night, uniting one of the most successful Japanese pitchers of his generation with a team in need of rotation help. The deal is for one year and $13 million, sources told ESPN.

The 35-year-old Sugano -- a two-time winner of the Sawamura Award, Nippon Professional Baseball's equivalent of the Cy Young Award -- nearly came to Major League Baseball after the Yomiuri Giants posted him in December 2020. He never signed, returned to the Giants and performed almost as well this year as in his Sawamura-winning 2017 and 2018 seasons.

In 24 starts this year, Sugano went 15-3 with a 1.67 ERA. Over 156 â…” innings, he struck out 111, walked only 16 and allowed six home runs. Though Sugano's fastball sits around 92 mph, nearly two-thirds of his pitches this year were off-speed -- a mixture of a slider, cutter, curveball and split-fingered fastball.
